            <h2 class="titilo"> What is Smart City </h2>

            <p> The first question is what is meant by a ‘smart city’. The answer is, there is no
                universally accepted definition of a smart city. It means different things to different
                people. The conceptualisation of Smart City, therefore, varies from city to city and
                country to country, depending on the level of development, willingness to change and
                reform, resources and aspirations of the city residents. A smart city would have a
                different connotation in India than, say, Europe. Even in India, there is no one way of
                defining a smart city.
                Some definitional boundaries are required to guide cities in the Mission. In the
                imagination of any city dweller in India, the picture of a smart city contains a wish list of
                infrastructure and services that describes his or her level of aspiration. To provide for
                the aspirations and needs of the citizens, urban planners ideally aim at developing the
                entire urban eco-system, which is represented by the four pillars of comprehensive
                development-institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure. This can be a
                long term goal and cities can work towards developing such comprehensive
                infrastructure incrementally, adding on layers of ‘smartness’
            </p>

            <p>
                In the approach of the Smart Cities Mission, the objective is to promote cities that
                provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and
                sustainable environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. The focus is on
                sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create
                a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities. The Smart Cities Mission of the Government is a bold, new initiative. It is meant to set
                examples that can be replicated both within and outside the Smart City, catalysing the
                creation of similar Smart Cities in various regions and parts of the country.
                The core infrastructure elements in a smart city would include:
                i. adequate water supply,
                ii. assured electricity supply,
                iii. sanitation, including solid waste management,
                iv. efficient urban mobility and public transport,
                v. affordable housing, especially for the poor,
                vi. robust IT connectivity and digitalization,
                vii. good governance, especially e-Governance and citizen participation,
                viii. sustainable environment,
                ix. safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly,
                and
                x. health and education.
                As far as Smart Solutions are concerned, an illustrative list is given below. This is
                not, however, an exhaustive list, and cities are free to add more applications.
